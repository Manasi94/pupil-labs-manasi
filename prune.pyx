    l is a list of object to quick_combine.
    the evaluation fn should accept idecies to your list and the list
    it should return a binary result on wether this set is good

    this search finds all combinations but assumes:
        that a bad subset can not be bettered by adding more nodes
        that a good set may not always be improved by a 'passing' superset (purging subsets will revoke this)

    if all items and their combinations pass the evaluation fn you get n**2 -1 solutions
    which leads to (2**n - 1) calls of your evaluation fn

    it needs more evaluations than finding strongly connected components in a graph because:
    (1,5) and (1,6) and (5,6) may work but (1,5,6) may not pass evaluation, (n,m) being list idx's
